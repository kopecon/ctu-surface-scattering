# CTU Surface Scattering Control Software

Control software for a **surface scattering measurement device** developed as a project at the **Czech Technical University in Prague – Faculty of Mechanical Engineering**.

## Overview

This repository contains Python code used to operate a custom-built measurement system designed to analyze surface scattering properties.

The device consists of:

- Three rotary servo motors for precise positioning  
- A scattering sensor for data acquisition  

The software coordinates motor movement, controls the measurement workflow, and enables automated experimental procedures.

## Features

- Servo motor control for multi-axis positioning  
- Sensor-driven measurement process  
- Modular Python architecture  
- Utilities for experiment execution
- Real-time data visualization
